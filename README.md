# concrete5 Theme Boilerplate
A base to begin building your concrete5 theme.

**This package is for concrete 5.7.1+ (also the upcoming version 8) for a < 5.6.x version see [here](https://github.com/olsgreen/concrete5-theme-boilerplate/tree/1.0).**

Note that if you are not familiar with concrete, want to generate a packaged theme or just want to speed up development, you can fill in a form and [generate a customised theme boilerplate](https://c5labs.com/concrete5-boilerplate/concrete5-starter-theme) at c5labs.com. This will provide you with a customised theme or package zip that you can simply extract to your packages or theme directory without the need to update namespaces, handles, etc.

## Installation

1. Copy the 'theme-boilerplate' folder to your concrete5 instances 'application/themes' folder.
2. Rename the copied theme folder to your desired theme name.
3. Update the namespace reference, name, description and theme handle within page_theme.php.
4. Login to the instance, click on the Settings icon on the right of the top bar, click 'Pages & Themes'.
5. Click on the 'Install' button next to the theme name you set in step 2.
6. Click on 'Return to Themes' in the lower left hand corner of your screen.
7. You will see the new theme listed, click 'Activate' to apply the theme to your site.
